> The standard library of python doesn't provide us the implementation for some non-linear data structures like BST, AVL, RedBlack, Disjoint Sets, Trie, Splay Tree, Binomial Heap, B Tree, B+ Tree, Skip List, Graphs and their various representations. So here in this repo I will write them with the best possible design.

Some of them present and are extremely useful like: [heap / priority queue](https://docs.python.org/2/library/heapq.html)

However, there's no special reason coz for so many applications the highly-tuned `dict` and `set` implementations (which are hash tables) work well.
